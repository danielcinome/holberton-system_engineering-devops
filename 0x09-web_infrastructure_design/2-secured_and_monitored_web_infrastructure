- Like the previous DNS cache. This infrastructure in part is general, not counting routers, ISP and others.
- Firewalls allow to have a secure system, this protects the devices connected to my network against unwanted
  access and possible loss of information, Additionally they allow me to deny services.
- Already this protocol allows me to have a secure connection, this means that I will not have access problems to information,
  injections and others since the packages that are sent are encrypted.
- It allows me to observe the metrics of the computer, record it and issue Alerts in case of something unusual or that can make the computer work properly.
  This can be divided into 2 types of application monitors, and server monitors.
- Through records that half report on performance or Performance Alerts
- It is necessary to implement software that allows me to have these metrics in order to know the scalability that the server needs to have.
- Because it acts as the end of the line or termination point
- Because in case of failures this would bring inconvenience with the performance of the application.
- Because, depending on the requirements, you would not always need the same characteristics, you probably only need processing or storage capacity on occasion.
