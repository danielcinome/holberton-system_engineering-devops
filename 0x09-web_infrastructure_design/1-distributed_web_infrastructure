- Well, once the user enters the URL the browser asks in DNS cache if the domain they are accessing is stored. If so,
  it directly requests and directs the location of the web application otherwise on a DNS server and requests the domain address.
- The load balancer is HAproxy which means it is a high availability and load balancing equlibrator.
  The Least Connection First Scheduling algorithm allows me to balance the servers in an orderly manner, one after the other.
  Additionally, it allows me to identify at what time one of the requests on the servers ends and send the next one to that one.
- It works in an Active-Active way since load balancing I am doing it proportionally. The main difference is that the passive waits
  until the Active server is full of requests, or when there is some kind of sudden, or scheduled, failure.
- It allows me to have a backup as part of performance or a solution to alleviate system failures.
- Load balancing allows me to have a much more stable system, in case of failure in one of the servers the application is backed by the other to continue working
- If there are, the connection is exposed to any type of injection or loss of information.
